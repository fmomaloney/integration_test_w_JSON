# README file for "integration test with JSON" project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some simple integrations tests
supported by" common data using JSON as an interchange format. 

This example works with a work project and has the following components:
1) Populate an online order form using a selenium script. This script reads JSON data and writes to form.
2) Verify and email notification against the JSON data. I am using imaplib and just verifying that strings appear in the email body.
3) Verify that submitted form info is saved to database  Script reads the JSON data and looks for relevant record. Some knowledge of schema is assumedd.
